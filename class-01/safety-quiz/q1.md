Electrical components can be hazardous if not handled properly. Capacitors inside the power supply unit (PSU) are responsible for helping convert current from 110AC to 12vDC. These Capacitors can continue to hold a significant electrical charge even after the PSU has been unplugged, because of this you should never open a PSU and should treat all capacitors as having an electrical charge. Marking “I understand” below indicates you have read and comprehend this safety advisory.
