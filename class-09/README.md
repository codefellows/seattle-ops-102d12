## Overview

Now that we have installed Windows 10 as a virtual machine, let's take a look at some foundational operations that Ops professionals perform in supporting and administering the popular OS. Like the Linux terminal, an aspiring Ops professional will need a basic grounding in Windows terminal as well as desktop interfaces. You won't be an expert after this class, but you'll know enough to get some essential tasks completed on this common business platform.

## How does this topic fit?

**Where we've been**:
In the previous class we deployed our first VM.

**What are we focusing on today**:
Today, we're going to explore basic Windows operations.

**Where we're headed**:
Next class is the review session and final exam.

## Basic Windows Operations

### Why
- Windows operating system is widely used across the world in personal computers, laptops, and many business environments. Knowing how to use it is a fundamental digital skill that is almost universally applicable.
- Understanding basic Windows operations helps in navigating the system efficiently. Users can find and open applications, manage files and folders, and customize their settings, leading to increased productivity.
- Basic Windows knowledge is crucial for troubleshooting common issues that users might face. Being able to diagnose and fix minor problems on your own can save time and frustration.
- Knowing how to create, move, copy, and delete files and folders is essential for organizing and managing data effectively. This knowledge prevents accidental data loss and aids in keeping information well-organized.
- Understanding Windows operations helps users install new software and applications, ensuring that their systems are up-to-date with the latest features and security patches. This is vital for maintaining a secure and functional computer system.

### What
- _______ are small graphical symbols representing files, folders, or applications on the desktop or within File Explorer.
- _______ is to duplicate a file or folder, creating an identical copy in a different location.
- _______ is to remove a file or folder from its current location and place it in the clipboard for moving to another location.
- _______ is to insert the contents of the clipboard (copied or cut data) into a new location.
- _______ is a method of moving files or folders by clicking and holding the item, dragging it to a new location, and releasing the mouse button to drop it.
- _______ is a system monitoring utility in Windows that provides information about running applications and processes, allowing users to manage and close them.
- _______ is a centralized configuration tool in Windows where users can adjust system settings, install or uninstall programs, and manage hardware and software.
- _______ are the level of access and permissions granted to a user account. Administrator accounts have higher privileges than Standard User accounts.
- _______ is comprehensive data about a computer's hardware and software configuration, including details about the processor, memory, storage, and installed software.
- _______ is a text-based interface in Windows where users can enter commands to perform various tasks, including retrieving system information.
- _______ is a Windows Command Prompt command used to display detailed system information.
- _______ is a hardware component that allows a computer to connect to a network. It can be wired (Ethernet) or wireless (Wi-Fi).
- _______ is a network diagnostic tool used to test the reachability of a host on an Internet Protocol (IP) network.
- _______ is a network diagnostic tool used to display the route and measure transit delays of packets across an Internet Protocol (IP) network.
- _______ is a software application used to access information on the World Wide Web. Google Chrome is a popular _______.
- _______ is a software application used to view and interact with Portable Document Format (PDF) files. SumatraPDF is an example of a _______.
- _______ is the relationship between a file type and the program used to open it. Associating Google Chrome with web browsing and SumatraPDF with PDF files means these programs will automatically open specific file types.

### How
Basic Windows operations are used in various ways to perform essential tasks and navigate the Windows operating system efficiently. Here's how these operations are typically used:
- **Accessing the Desktop**: After logging in, users are presented with the desktop, where they can see icons representing files, folders, and applications. Double-clicking an icon opens the associated file or program.
- **Start Menu**: Clicking the Start button opens the Start menu, from which users can access programs, documents, settings, and power options.
- **File Management with File Explorer**:
    - **Browsing Files and Folders**: File Explorer allows users to navigate the file system, view files and folders, and open them by double-clicking.
    - **Creating New Folders/Files**: Users can create new folders or files by right-clicking in File Explorer and selecting the appropriate option.
    - **Copying and Moving Files**: Files can be copied by right-clicking, selecting "Copy," and pasted in another location. To move files, users can use the "Cut" operation followed by "Paste."
    - **Drag and Drop**: Users can drag files or folders from one location to another using the mouse.
- **Taskbar Operations**:
    - **Opening Applications**: Clicking an application icon on the taskbar opens the corresponding program.
    - **Switching Between Applications**: Clicking on open application icons on the taskbar switches between different open programs.
    - **System Tray**: Icons in the system tray provide access to system and application notifications. Users can interact with these icons for specific actions.
- **Control Panel and Settings**:
    - **Control Panel**: Users can access the Control Panel to customize system settings, manage hardware, and uninstall programs.
    - **Settings**: Windows 10 and later versions offer a modern Settings app where users can personalize their system, configure devices, manage accounts, and more.
- **Managing User Accounts**:
    - **User Account Control (UAC)**: UAC prompts users for permission when changes are made to the system settings or when installing/uninstalling software.
    - **User Accounts**: Users can create, modify, or remove user accounts through the Control Panel or Settings app.
- **System Maintenance**:
    - **Updates**: Windows Update feature ensures the operating system and software are up-to-date with the latest security patches and improvements.
    - **Task Manager**: Task Manager allows users to monitor and manage running applications, processes, and system performance.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Various keyboard shortcuts, such as Ctrl+C (Copy), Ctrl+X (Cut), Ctrl+V (Paste), Alt+Tab (Switch between open applications), and Win+D (Show desktop), enhance the efficiency of basic Windows operations.

### Experimentation and Discovery Ideas
- Imagine a scenario where there were no folders or files. How would you propose organizing and accessing information on a computer? What challenges might arise, and how does the concept of files and folders address these challenges?
- Considering the variety of tasks people use computers for, why do you think there are different types of user accounts, like administrators and standard users, on Windows? How might these distinctions be important in terms of security and system stability?
- As technology evolves, so do the ways we interact with it. Do you believe that the fundamental concepts of operating systems, such as files, folders, and user accounts, will remain unchanged in the future? Or can you envision entirely new paradigms for organizing digital information and user interactions?
- Reflecting on your experience using Windows, can you think of an instance where a keyboard shortcut significantly expedited a task? How do these shortcuts enhance user efficiency, and how might they influence the future design of operating systems?
- Imagine explaining basic Windows operations to someone who has never used a computer before. What fundamental concepts would you prioritize, and why? How might understanding these basics empower a person to explore and experiment with more advanced features and applications?
